Pidgin Plus! is a free-software project intended to make Pidgin more comfortable across multiple
protocols by unifying commands as done in Messenger Plus! for Windows Messenger.

Pidgin Plus! incorporates a JavaScript based scripting system powered by Google V8, in order to
promote simpler plugin authoring. At the moment, this functionality is experimental. You can try
it out by prefixing messages with "js:" (the remainder of the message will be executed by V8 as
JavaScript).

The following commands are introduced for all protocols:
/appearoffline - Sets the status to "Invisible."
/available - Sets the status to "Available." Same as /online.
/away - Sets the status to "Away," or "Extended away" on some protocols.
/block - Attempt to block someone. Pidgin's blocks are buggy; use with caution.
/blockgrp - Block an entire group by name. Just don't use this.
/close - Close the current conversation window.
/invite - TBI. Will create a chat from the current conversation and invite the requested user.
/noicon - Prevents emoticons in messages. Only for MSN protocol.
/online - Sets the status to "Available." Same as /available.
/onphone - Sets the status to "Busy." This is from an old MSN Plus! version.
/say - Sends a message, in the current window, as yourself. Not very useful.
/signout - Disconnect from all protocols.
